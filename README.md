### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jorge from Valencia, Spain. My background is in Cartography and Geodesy Engineering, and I develop my professional career around Geospatial Information Systems and Open Source Software and Data. I'm currently working at the [Kibana Maps](https://www.elastic.co/es/maps) team at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) as a geospatial engineer.

You can check my [resume](https://jorgesanz.net/resume/), [blog](https://jorgesanz.net/posts/),  [etc.](https://jorgesanz.net/links/) for more details about myself and what I'm up to these days.

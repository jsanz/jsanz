### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jorge from Valencia, Spain. My background is in Cartography and Geodesy Engineering, and I develop my professional career around Geospatial Information Systems and Open Source Software and Data. I'm currently working at the Kibana [Presentation](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/kibana-dashboard) and [Maps](https://www.elastic.co/es/maps) team at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) as a geospatial engineer.
